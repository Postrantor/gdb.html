### 15.3 Type and Range Checking

Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common errors through a series of compile- and run-time checks. These include checking the type of arguments to functions and operators and making sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time. Checks such as these help to ensure a program's correctness once it has been compiled by eliminating type mismatches and providing active checks for range errors when your program is running.

By default [GDB] for evaluation via the `print` command, for example.
