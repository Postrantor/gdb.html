#### 33.4.6 Letting Readline Type For You

`complete (TAB)`

:   Attempt to perform completion on the text before point. The actual completion performed is application-specific. The default is filename completion.

`possible-completions (M-?)`

:   List the possible completions of the text before point. When displaying completions, Readline sets the number of columns used for display to the value of `completion-display-width`, the value of the environment variable `COLUMNS`, or the screen width, in that order.

`insert-completions (M-*)`

:   Insert all completions of the text before point that would have been generated by `possible-completions`.

`menu-complete ()`

:   Similar to `complete`, but replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list of possible completions. Repeated execution of `menu-complete` steps through the list of possible completions, inserting each match in turn. At the end of the list of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of `bell-style`) and the original text is restored. An argument of `n` positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argument may be used to move backward through the list. This command is intended to be bound to TAB, but is unbound by default.

`menu-complete-backward ()`

:   Identical to `menu-complete`, but moves backward through the list of possible completions, as if `menu-complete` had been given a negative argument.

`delete-char-or-list ()`

:   Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or end of the line (like `delete-char`). If at the end of the line, behaves identically to `possible-completions`. This command is unbound by default.
