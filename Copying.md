### Preamble


The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

> GNU通用公共许可证是一种免费的、面向软件和其他作品的copyleft许可证。


The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program---to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

> 大多数软件和其他实用性的作品都有许可证，旨在剥夺你分享和更改作品的自由。相比之下，GNU通用公共许可证旨在保障你分享和更改程序的所有版本的自由，以确保它永远是所有用户的自由软件。我们，自由软件基金会，使用GNU通用公共许可证为我们的大多数软件；它也适用于以这种方式发布的其他任何作品。你也可以将它应用到你的程序上。


When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

> 当我们谈论自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您有自由来分发免费软件的副本（如果您愿意，可以收费），您可以获取源代码或者如果您想要的话可以得到它，您可以更改软件或使用其中的一些片段来编写新的免费程序，以及您知道您可以做这些事情。


To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

> 为了保护你的权利，我们需要防止他人否认你这些权利或要求你放弃这些权利。因此，如果你分发软件的副本或者修改它，你有一定的责任来尊重他人的自由。


For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

> 例如，如果你分发这样一个程序的副本，无论是免费还是收费，你必须将同样的自由传递给收件人。你必须确保他们也能收到或获得源代码。你必须向他们展示这些条款，让他们知道自己的权利。


Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

> 开发者使用GNU GPL保护您的权利有两个步骤：（1）对软件断言版权，（2）向您提供本许可证，给您拷贝、分发和/或修改的法律许可。


For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

> 为了保护开发者和作者，GPL 清楚地解释了这个自由软件没有提供任何担保。为了用户和作者的利益，GPL 要求修改版本必须标记为已更改，以免将问题错误地归因于以前版本的作者。


Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

> 一些设备被设计成拒绝用户安装或运行软件内部的修改版本，尽管制造商可以这样做。这与保护用户自由更改软件的目的是根本不兼容的。这种滥用的系统模式出现在个人使用的产品领域，这正是它最不可接受的地方。因此，我们设计了这个版本的GPL，禁止这种做法在这些产品上。如果在其他领域出现了这样的问题，我们准备在未来版本的GPL中将此规定扩展到这些领域，以保护用户的自由。


Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

> 最后，所有程序都受到软件专利的不断威胁。各国不应允许专利限制通用计算机上的软件的开发和使用，但在那些允许的国家中，我们希望避免对免费软件施加的专利可能使其变得非自由的特殊危险。为了防止这种情况，GPL保证专利不能用来使程序变得非自由。


The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

> 精确的复制、分发和修改条款和条件如下。

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.


   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

> "版权"也指适用于其他类型作品（如半导体掩模）的类似版权法律。


   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

> "程序"指这一许可协议下授权的任何可版权的作品。每个许可人被称为"你"。"许可人"和"受许可人"可以是个人或组织。


   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

> "修改"一项作品意味着复制或改编全部或部分作品，除了制作准确的副本外，还需要获得版权许可。由此产生的作品被称为早期作品的"修改版本"或"基于"早期作品的作品。


   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

> 一个“覆盖的工作”指的是未经修改的程序或基于程序的工作。


   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

> 要“传播”一项工作意味着根据适用的版权法律，在未经许可的情况下，对其进行任何操作，以致直接或间接地使您承担侵权责任，除了在计算机上执行它或修改私人副本外。传播包括复制、分发（有或无修改）、向公众提供，在某些国家还包括其他活动。


   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

> 传达一项工作意味着任何可以使其他各方制作或接收副本的传播。仅通过计算机网络与用户进行交互，而不传达副本，则不算传达。


   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

> 交互式用户界面会显示“适当的法律声明”，它包括方便显眼的功能，显示适当的版权声明，并告知用户没有保证（除非有保证提供），授权人可以根据本许可证转让作品，以及如何查看本许可证的副本。如果界面显示用户命令或选项列表，如菜单，列表中的突出项目符合此标准。
1. Source Code.


   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

> 源代码是指工作的首选形式，用于对其进行修改。“目标代码”是指工作的任何非源形式。


   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

> "标准接口"是指一种由认可的标准机构定义的官方标准的接口，或者是为某种特定编程语言规定的接口，而这种接口在使用该语言的开发者中被广泛使用。


   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

> 程序工作的“系统库”包括任何与整个工作无关的东西，它们（a）包含在主要组件的正常包装形式中，但不属于该主要组件，并且（b）仅用于使用该主要组件使用该工作或实现可以以源代码形式向公众提供的标准接口。 在此上下文中，“主要组件”是指特定操作系统（如果有）上可执行工作运行的主要基本组件（内核，窗口系统等），或用于生成工作的编译器，或用于运行它的目标代码解释器。


   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

> "對應源碼"對於以物件碼形式的作品，指的是所有用於生成、安裝（對於可執行作品）並執行物件碼，以及修改作品的源碼，包括控制這些活動的腳本。但是，它不包括作品的系統庫、通用工具或通常可免費使用的程式，它們未經修改地用於執行這些活動，但不是作品的一部分。例如，對應源碼包括與作品源碼相關聯的介面定義檔案，以及作品特別設計為需要的共用庫和動態鏈接子程式的源碼，例如通過密切的數據傳輸或控制流程在這些子程式和作品的其他部分之間。


   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

> 相应的源代码不需要包括任何用户可以从相应源代码的其他部分自动重新生成的内容。


   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

> 相应的源代码形式的作品就是同一份作品。
2. Basic Permissions.


   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

> 所有根据本许可授予的权利均以程序的版权期限为期限授予，在满足规定条件的情况下不可撤销。本许可明确肯定您无限制地运行未经修改的程序的权利。只有当其内容符合本许可的规定时，运行的受保护作品的输出才受本许可的保护。本许可承认您依据版权法享有的公平使用权或其他等效权利。


   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

> 你可以创建、运行和传播你不拥有版权的被覆盖的作品，只要你的许可证仍然有效，就没有任何条件。你可以把被覆盖的作品传递给其他人，仅为了让他们为你做出修改，或者提供你运行这些作品的设施，前提是你在传播所有你不控制版权的材料时遵守本许可证的条款。那些为你制作或运行被覆盖的作品的人必须完全代表你，在你的指导和控制下，并且以禁止他们在与你的关系之外复制你的版权材料为条件进行。


   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

> 在任何其他情况下转让均仅受以下条件限制。不允许再许可；第10条使其不必要。
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.


   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

> 没有受到覆盖的作品应被视为在1996年12月20日通过的《世界知识产权组织版权公约》第11条或类似的禁止或限制绕过此类措施的法律下的有效技术措施的一部分。


   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

> 当您传播一项覆盖的作品时，您放弃了任何法律权力，以防止通过行使本许可协议针对覆盖作品的权利而实施的技术措施的绕过，并且您声明不打算以限制作品的运行或修改作为手段，以执行您或第三方向作品用户禁止技术措施绕过的法律权利。
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.


   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

> 你可以按照你收到的原样把程序的源代码传输到任何媒介，只要你在每份拷贝上显著适当地发布适当的版权声明；保留所有声明，表明本许可证和符合第7节的任何非宽容条款适用于该代码；保留所有关于没有任何保证的通知；并且随程序一起向所有受益人提供本许可证的副本。


   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

> 你可以为每一份传达的副本收取任何价格，或者不收取任何费用，你也可以收取费用提供支持或保修保护。
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.


   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

> 你可以根据程序提供的作品传达，或者修改以生成该程序，以源代码的形式在第4节的条款下提供，前提是你也满足所有这些条件：


   a.  The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

> 工作必须带有明显的通知，表明您对其进行了修改，并给出相关日期。

   b.  The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

> b. 这项工作必须带有明显的通知，声明它是根据本许可发布的，并根据第7节添加的任何条件。此要求修改第4节中的要求，即“保留所有通知”。

   c.  You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

> 你必须根据本许可证将整个作品授权给任何拥有副本的人。 因此，本许可证将与任何适用的第7条附加条款一起适用于整个作品及其所有部分，而不管它们如何打包。 本许可证不授予以其他方式许可该作品的权限，但如果您另外获得了该许可，则不会使其无效。

   d.  If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

> 如果作品具有交互式用户界面，每个界面都必须显示适当的法律声明；但是，如果程序具有不显示适当法律声明的交互界面，您的作品也不必让它们这样做。


   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

> 结合了受保护作品与其他独立且不属于受保护作品本质扩展的作品，并且未与其合并形成更大的程序的编译，若该编译及其版权不用于限制编译用户超出单独作品允许的访问或法律权限，则称为“聚合”。将受保护作品纳入聚合中，不会导致本许可协议适用于聚合的其他部分。
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.


   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

> 你可以根据第4和第5节的条款以对象代码形式传达一项被覆盖的作品，前提是你也要根据本许可传达机器可读的相应源代码，以下列方式之一：


   a.  Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

> 将目标代码载入到一个实体产品（包括一个物理分发媒介）中，或者被嵌入到一个实体产品中，并附带相应的源代码，这些源代码固定在一个常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上。

   b.  Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

> b. 将对象代码包含在物理产品（包括物理发行介质）中，并附有一份书面报价，有效期至少三年，只要你提供该产品型号的备件或客户支持，都有效，以便任何拥有该对象代码的人能够（1）以不超过你实施物理转移源码的合理成本的价格，以通常用于软件交换的持久物理介质提供该产品中所有受本许可协议覆盖的软件的相应源码的副本，或（2）免费从网络服务器获取相应源码的访问权限。

   c.  Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

> c. 随着提供相应源代码的书面报价，传递对象代码的个人副本。这种替代方案仅在偶尔和非商业情况下允许，并且仅当您根据第6b节收到对象代码时才允许。

   d.  Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

> d. 通过从指定地点（免费或收费）提供对象代码来传达对象代码，并以同样的方式以同样的地点不收取额外费用提供相应源代码的相应访问权限。您无需要求收件人复制相应源代码和对象代码一起复制。如果复制对象代码的地点是网络服务器，则相应源代码可以位于不同的服务器（由您或第三方操作）上，该服务器支持等效的复制设施，前提是您在对象代码旁边保留明确的指示，指出在哪里可以找到相应的源代码。无论相应源代码位于哪个服务器上，您仍然有责任确保它在满足这些要求所需的时间内仍然可用。

   e.  Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

> e. 通过点对点传输传送对象代码，只要您通知其他节点该对象代码及相应源代码在第6d节中免费向公众提供。


   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

> 一部分可分离的对象代码，其源代码被排除在相应源码之外作为系统库，无需包括在传输对象代码工作中。


   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

> "用户产品"既可以是（1）"消费品"，即通常用于个人、家庭或家用目的的任何有形个人财产，也可以是（2）为住宅而设计或销售的任何东西。在确定一种产品是否为消费品时，可疑情况应有利于覆盖。对于特定用户收到的特定产品，"通常使用"是指该类产品的典型或常见用途，而不管特定用户的状态或特定用户实际使用、预期使用或预期使用产品的方式。产品是消费品，而不管产品是否具有重大的商业、工业或非消费用途，除非这些用途代表产品唯一重要的使用方式。


   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

> "用户产品的安装信息"指的是从其对应源代码的修改版本中安装和执行覆盖工作的修改版本所需的任何方法、程序、授权密钥或其他信息。该信息必须足以确保修改后的对象代码的持续运行不会因为修改而被阻止或干扰。


   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

> 如果您在用户产品中传输本节中的对象代码，或者为用户产品使用，或者特别用于用户产品，并且传输发生在一笔交易中，其中用户产品的所有权和使用权永久转移给接收者，或者转移给接收者一个固定期限（不管交易如何表征），本节传输的相应源代码必须伴随安装信息。但是，如果您或任何第三方都不再具备在用户产品上安装修改过的对象代码的能力（例如，该作品已经安装在ROM中），则不适用此要求。


   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

> 要求提供安装信息并不包括要求继续为受捐赠者修改或安装的作品或其中修改或安装的用户产品提供支持服务、保修或更新的要求。当修改本身实质性地且不利地影响网络的运行或违反网络间通信的规则和协议时，可以拒绝访问网络。


   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

> 相应的源码必须以公开文档格式提供（并公开源代码），不需要特殊密码或密钥来解压、阅读或复制。
7. Additional Terms.


   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

> 附加权限是补充本许可协议的条款，通过从其中一个或多个条件中作出例外。适用于整个程序的附加权限将被视为包含在本许可协议中，在可适用法律范围内是有效的。如果附加权限仅适用于程序的一部分，则该部分可以根据这些权限单独使用，但整个程序仍受本许可协议的约束，而不受附加权限的限制。


   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

> 当你传达一份受版权保护的作品时，你可以选择从该副本或其中的任何部分中移除任何额外的权限。（在某些情况下，当你修改作品时，可能会有额外的权限要求自行移除。）你可以为你添加到受版权保护的作品中的材料添加额外的权限，你可以提供适当的版权许可。


   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

> 除了本许可证的其他规定外，对于您添加到涵盖的作品中的材料，您可以（如果经该材料的版权持有人授权）用条款补充本许可证的条款：


   a.  Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

> a. 在本许可协议第15和16条款的规定与此不同地放弃保证或限制责任。

   b.  Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

> 要求保留在该材料中或在包含它的作品中显示的适当法律通知或作者归属的指定合理法律通知。

   c.  Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

> 禁止歪曲该材料的起源，或要求以合理的方式将修改后的版本与原版本标记为不同。

   d.  Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

> 限制使用授權人或材料作者的名字作宣傳用途。

   e.  Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

> 拒绝根据商标法授予使用某些商标、商标或服务商标的权利。

   f.  Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

> 要求被轉移物質（或其修改版本）的授權人和作者對接收者的合同責任做出賠償，以應對這些合同責任對授權人和作者直接施加的任何責任。


   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

> 所有其他非许可的附加条款被视为本条款第10节中所指的“进一步限制”。如果您收到的程序或其中的任何部分包含声明，说明它受本许可协议的管辖，并带有一个进一步限制的条款，您可以删除该条款。如果许可文件包含进一步的限制，但允许根据本许可协议重新许可或转让，您可以添加受该许可文件规定管辖的被覆盖作品的材料，前提是该进一步限制不能继续存在于重新许可或转让中。


   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

> 如果您根据本节添加条款到一项受保护的作品，您必须在相关源文件中放置一份有关附加条款的声明，或者一份指示如何找到适用条款的通知。


   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

> 附加条款，无论是宽容的还是不宽容的，可以以单独书面许可的形式表述，或者以例外的形式表述；无论如何，上述要求都适用。
8. Termination.


   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

> 你不得传播或修改本许可下的受保护作品，除非经本许可明确允许。任何试图传播或修改的行为都是无效的，并将自动终止你在本许可下的权利（包括第11条第三款规定的任何专利许可）。


   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

> 然而，如果你停止所有违反本许可的行为，那么你从特定版权持有者那里获得的许可将重新生效（a）暂时地，除非和直到版权持有者明确最终终止了你的许可，以及（b）永久地，如果版权持有者在停止行为60天之前未能通过一些合理的方式通知你违规行为。


   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

> 此外，如果某个版权持有者以合理的方式通知您违反了许可，且这是您第一次收到该版权持有者违反本许可的通知（任何作品），您在收到通知后30天内治愈违反行为，则您的许可将永久恢复。


   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

> 此部分的您的权利终止，不会终止那些从您处接收到本许可证拷贝或权利的其他方的许可。如果您的权利已被终止，并且没有永久恢复，您将不符合根据第10条获得相同材料的新许可的资格。
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.


   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

> 你不需要接受本许可协议才能接收或运行程序的副本。仅仅因为使用点对点传输接收副本而发生的辅助传播也不需要接受。但是，除了本许可协议之外，没有任何东西给你授权传播或修改任何受保护的作品。如果您不接受本许可协议，这些行动将侵犯版权。因此，通过修改或传播受保护的作品，您表明您接受本许可协议进行此操作。
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.

    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

### END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs


If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

> 如果你开发了一个新的程序，并且你希望它能够对公众产生最大的可能用途，最好的方法就是将它变成免费软件，每个人都可以在这些条款下重新发布和修改它。


To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

> 要做到这一点，请将以下公告附加到程序中。最安全的方法是将它们附加到每个源文件的开头，以最有效地声明排除保证；每个文件至少应包含“版权”行和指向完整公告所在位置的指针。

::: smallexample

```bash
one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) year name of author

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
```

:::

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.


If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

> 如果程序进行终端交互，在交互模式下启动时，请输出类似于下面的简短提示：

::: smallexample

```bash
program Copyright (C) year name of author
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.
```

:::


The hypothetical commands '`show w`' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

> 假设的命令“show w”应该显示适当的通用公共许可证部分。当然，你的程序的命令可能会有所不同；对于GUI界面，你可以使用“关于框”。


You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

> 你也应该让你的雇主（如果你是一名程序员）或者学校签署一份“版权声明”，如果有必要的话。要了解更多有关此事，以及如何申请和遵循GNU GPL，请参阅[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)。


The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html).

> 许可证GNU通用公共许可证不允许将您的程序纳入专有程序中。如果您的程序是子程序库，您可能会认为允许将专有应用程序与该库链接更有用。如果这是您想要做的，请使用GNU通用公共许可证替代本许可证。但首先，请阅读[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html)。
