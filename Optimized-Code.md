## 11 Debugging Optimized Code

Almost all compilers support optimization. With optimization disabled, the compiler generates assembly code that corresponds directly to your source code, in a simplistic way. As the compiler applies more powerful optimizations, the generated assembly code diverges from your original source code. With help from debugging information generated by the compiler, [GDB] can map from the running program back to constructs from your original source.

[GDB] is more accurate with optimization disabled. If you can recompile without optimization, it is easier to follow the progress of your program during debugging. But, there are many cases where you may need to debug an optimized version.

When you debug a program compiled with '`-g -O` never sees that variable---because the compiler optimizes it out of existence.

Some things do not work as well with '`-g -O`' alone, and if this fixes the problem, please report it to us as a bug (including a test case!). See [Variables](Variables.html#Variables), for more information about debugging optimized code.
