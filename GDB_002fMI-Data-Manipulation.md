### 27.16 [GDB/MI]

This section describes the [GDB/MI] commands that manipulate data: examine memory and registers, evaluate expressions, etc.

For details about what an addressable memory unit is, see [addressable memory unit](Memory.html#addressable-memory-unit).

#### The `-data-disassemble` Command

#### Synopsis

::: smallexample

```bash
 -data-disassemble
  ( -s start-addr -e end-addr
  | -a addr
  | -f filename -l linenum [ -n lines ] )
  [ --opcodes opcodes-mode ]
  [ --source ]
  [ -- mode ]
```

:::

Where:

'`start-addr`'

:   is the beginning address (or `$pc`)

'`end-addr`'

:   is the end address

'`addr`'

:   is an address anywhere within (or the name of) the function to disassemble. If an address is specified, the whole function surrounding that address will be disassembled. If a name is specified, the whole function with that name will be disassembled.

'`filename`'

:   is the name of the file to disassemble

'`linenum`'

:   is the line number to disassemble around

'`lines`'

:   is the number of disassembly lines to be produced. If it is -1, the whole function will be disassembled, in case no `end-addr` are displayed.

'`opcodes-mode`'

:   can only be used with `mode` 0, and should be one of the following:

```
'`none`'

:   no opcode information will be included in the result.

'`bytes`'

:   opcodes will be included in the result, the opcodes will be formatted as for [disassemble /b].

'`display`'

:   opcodes will be included in the result, the opcodes will be formatted as for [disassemble /r].
```

'`mode`'

:   the use of `mode` should be one of:

```
'`0`'

:   *disassembly only*, this is the default mode if no mode is specified.

'`1`'

:   *mixed source and disassembly (deprecated)*, it is not possible to recreate this mode using `--opcodes` and `--source` options.

'`2`'

:   *disassembly with raw opcodes*, this mode is equivalent to using `mode` 0 and passing `--opcodes bytes` to the command.

'`3`'

:   *mixed source and disassembly with raw opcodes (deprecated)*, it is not possible to recreate this mode using `--opcodes` and `--source` options.

'`4`'

:   *mixed source and disassembly*, this mode is equivalent to using `mode` 0 and passing `--source` to the command.

'`5`'

:   *mixed source and disassembly with raw opcodes*, this mode is equivalent to using `mode` 0 and passing `--opcodes bytes` and `--source` to the command.

Modes 1 and 3 are deprecated. The output is "source centric" which hasn't proved useful in practice. See [Machine Code](Machine-Code.html#Machine-Code), for a discussion of the difference between `/m` and `/s` output of the `disassemble` command.
```

The `--source` can only be used with `mode` 4 or 5 had been used.

#### Result

The result of the `-data-disassemble` command will be a list named '`asm_insns`', the contents of this list depend on the options used with the `-data-disassemble` command.

For modes 0 and 2, and when the `--source` option is not used, the '`asm_insns`' list contains tuples with the following fields:

`address`

:   The address at which this instruction was disassembled.

`func-name`

:   The name of the function this instruction is within.

`offset`

:   The decimal offset in bytes from the start of '`func-name`'.

`inst`

:   The text disassembly for this '`address`'.

`opcodes`

:   This field is only present for modes 2, 3 and 5, or when the `--opcodes` option '`bytes`' field.

```
When the '`--opcodes`](Machine-Code.html#disassemble)).

When '`--opcodes` command.
```

For modes 1, 3, 4 and 5, or when the `--source` option is used, the '`asm_insns`', each of which has the following fields:

`line`

:   The line number within '`file`'.

`file`

:   The file name from the compilation unit. This might be an absolute file name or a relative file name depending on the compile command used.

`fullname`

:   Absolute file name of '`file`'. It is converted to a canonical form using the source file search path (see [Specifying Source Directories](Source-Path.html#Source-Path)) and after resolving all the symbolic links.

```
If the source file is not found this field will contain the path as present in the debug information.
```

`line_asm_insn`

:   This is a list of tuples containing the disassembly for '`line`'.

Note that whatever included in the '`inst`, i.e., it is not possible to adjust its format.

#### [GDB]

The corresponding [GDB]'.

#### Example

Disassemble from the current value of `$pc` to `$pc + 20`:

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb)
-data-disassemble -s $pc -e "$pc + 20" -- 0
^done,
asm_insns=[
{address="0x000107c0",func-name="main",offset="4",
inst="mov  2, %o0"},
{address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
{address="0x000107c8",func-name="main",offset="12",
inst="or  %o2, 0x140, %o1\t! 0x11940 <_lib_version+8>"},
{address="0x000107cc",func-name="main",offset="16",
inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
{address="0x000107d0",func-name="main",offset="20",
inst="or  %o2, 0x168, %o4\t! 0x11968 <_lib_version+48>"}]
(gdb)
```

 -data-list-register-names [ ( regno )+ ]
```

:::

Show a list of register names for the current target. If no arguments are given, it shows a list of the names of all the registers. If integer numbers are given as arguments, it will print a list of the names of the registers corresponding to the arguments. To ensure consistency between a register name and its number, the output list may include empty register names.

```bash
 -data-list-register-values
    [ --skip-unavailable ] fmt [ ( regno )*]
```

:::

Display the registers' contents. The format according to which the registers' contents are to be returned is given by `fmt`, followed by an optional list of numbers specifying the registers to display. A missing list of numbers indicates that the contents of all the registers must be returned. The `--skip-unavailable` option indicates that only the available registers are to be returned.

Allowed formats for `fmt` are:

`x`

:   Hexadecimal

`o`

:   Octal

`t`

:   Binary

`d`

:   Decimal

`r`

:   Raw

`N`

:   Natural

#### The `-data-read-memory` Command

This command is deprecated, use `-data-read-memory-bytes` instead.

#### Synopsis

::: smallexample

```bash
 -data-read-memory [ -o byte-offset ]
   address word-format word-size
   nr-rows nr-cols [ aschar ]
```

:::

where:

'`address`'

:   An expression specifying the address of the first memory word to be read. Complex expressions containing embedded white space should be quoted using the C convention.

'`word-format`'

:   The format to be used to print the memory words. The notation is the same as for [GDB]'s `print` command (see [Output Formats](Output-Formats.html#Output-Formats)).

'`word-size`'

:   The size of each memory word in bytes.

'`nr-rows`'

:   The number of rows in the output table.

'`nr-cols`'

:   The number of columns in the output table.

'`aschar`'

:   If present, indicates that each row should include an [ASCII] characters are those whose code is between 32 and 126, inclusively).

'`byte-offset`'

:   An offset to add to the `address` before fetching memory.

This command displays memory contents as a table of `nr-rows`'.

The address of the next/previous row or page is available in '`next-row`'.

#### [GDB]

The corresponding [GDB]' memory read command.

#### Example

Read six bytes of memory starting at `bytes+6` but then offset by `-6` bytes. Format as three rows of two columns. One byte per word. Display each word in hex.

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb)
9-data-read-memory -o -6 -- bytes+6 x 1 3 2
9^done,addr="0x00001390",nr-bytes="6",total-bytes="6",
next-row="0x00001396",prev-row="0x0000138e",next-page="0x00001396",
prev-page="0x0000138a",memory=[
,
,
]
(gdb)
```

:::

Read two bytes of memory starting at address `shorts + 64` and display as a single word formatted in decimal.

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb)
5-data-read-memory shorts+64 d 2 1 1
5^done,addr="0x00001510",nr-bytes="2",total-bytes="2",
next-row="0x00001512",prev-row="0x0000150e",
next-page="0x00001512",prev-page="0x0000150e",memory=[
]
(gdb)
```

:::

Read thirty two bytes of memory starting at `bytes+16` and format as eight rows of four columns. Include a string encoding with '`x`' used as the non-printable character.

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb)
4-data-read-memory bytes+16 x 1 8 4 x
4^done,addr="0x000013a0",nr-bytes="32",total-bytes="32",
next-row="0x000013c0",prev-row="0x0000139c",
next-page="0x000013c0",prev-page="0x00001380",memory=[
,
,
,
,
,

]
(gdb)
```

:::

#### The `-data-read-memory-bytes` Command

#### Synopsis

::: smallexample

```bash
 -data-read-memory-bytes [ -o offset ]
   address count
```

:::

where:

'`address`'

:   An expression specifying the address of the first addressable memory unit to be read. Complex expressions containing embedded white space should be quoted using the C convention.

'`count`'

:   The number of addressable memory units to read. This should be an integer literal.

'`offset`'

:   The offset relative to `address` at which to start reading. This should be an integer literal. This option is provided so that a frontend is not required to first evaluate address and then perform address arithmetics itself.

This command attempts to read all accessible memory regions in the specified range. First, all regions marked as unreadable in the memory map (if one is defined) will be skipped. See [Memory Region Attributes](Memory-Region-Attributes.html#Memory-Region-Attributes). Second, [GDB] will try to read a subset of the region.

In general, every single memory unit in the region may be readable or not, and the only way to read every readable unit is to try a read at every address, which is not practical. Therefore, [GDB] will not read it.

The result record (see [GDB/MI Result Records](GDB_002fMI-Result-Records.html#GDB_002fMI-Result-Records)) that is output of the command includes a field named '`memory`' whose content is a list of tuples. Each tuple represent a successfully read memory block and has the following fields:

`begin`

:   The start address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.

`end`

:   The end address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.

`offset`

:   The offset of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal, relative to the start address passed to `-data-read-memory-bytes`.

`contents`

:   The contents of the memory block, in hex.

#### [GDB]

The corresponding [GDB]'.

#### Example

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb)
-data-read-memory-bytes &a 10
^done,memory=[{begin="0xbffff154",offset="0x00000000",
              end="0xbffff15e",
              contents="01000000020000000300"}]
(gdb)
```

:::

#### The `-data-write-memory-bytes` Command

#### Synopsis

::: smallexample

```bash
 -data-write-memory-bytes address contents
 -data-write-memory-bytes address contents [count]
```

:::

where:

'`address`'

:   An expression specifying the address of the first addressable memory unit to be written. Complex expressions containing embedded white space should be quoted using the C convention.

'`contents`'

:   The hex-encoded data to write. It is an error if `contents` does not represent an integral number of addressable memory units.

'`count`'

:   Optional argument indicating the number of addressable memory units to be written. If `count` memory units.

#### [GDB]

There's no corresponding [GDB] command.

#### Example

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb)
-data-write-memory-bytes &a "aabbccdd"
^done
(gdb)
```

:::

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb)
-data-write-memory-bytes &a "aabbccdd" 16e
^done
(gdb)
```
