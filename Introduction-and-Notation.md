### 33.1 Introduction to Line Editing


The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent keystrokes.

> 以下段落描述了用于表示按键的符号。


The text [C-k] is read as 'Control-K' and describes the character produced when the k key is pressed while the Control key is depressed.

> 文本[C-k]被读作“Control-K”，描述的是当按下Control键时按下K键时产生的字符。


The text [M-k] is read as 'Meta-K' and describes the character produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the k key is pressed. The Meta key is labeled ALT on many keyboards. On keyboards with two keys labeled ALT (usually to either side of the space bar), the ALT on the left side is generally set to work as a Meta key. The ALT key on the right may also be configured to work as a Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a Compose key for typing accented characters.

> 文本[M-k]被读作'Meta-K'，描述的是当按下Meta键（如果有的话），再按下k键时产生的字符。许多键盘上的Meta键被标记为ALT。在有两个标有ALT（通常在空格键两侧）的键盘上，左侧的ALT通常被设置为工作为Meta键。右侧的ALT键也可以配置为工作为Meta键，也可以配置为其他修饰键，如用于输入重音字符的组合键。


If you do not have a Meta or ALT key, or another key working as a Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing ESC *first*, and then typing k. Either process is known as *metafying* the k key.

> 如果您没有Meta或ALT键，或其他可以作为Meta键的键，可以先按ESC，然后再按k来生成相同的按键。这两种方式都被称为使k键具有Meta功能。

The text [M-C-k].


In addition, several keys have their own names. Specifically, DEL, ESC, LFD, SPC, RET, and TAB all stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file (see [Readline Init File](Readline-Init-File.html#Readline-Init-File)). If your keyboard lacks a LFD key, typing C-j will produce the desired character. The RET key may be labeled Return or Enter on some keyboards.

> 此外，有几个按键有自己的名字。具体来说，DEL、ESC、LFD、SPC、RET和TAB在这段文字中或者在初始文件中都可以表示它们自己（参见[Readline Init File](Readline-Init-File.html#Readline-Init-File)）。如果你的键盘没有LFD按键，按下C-j就可以产生所需的字符。有些键盘上RET键可能标记为Return或者Enter。
