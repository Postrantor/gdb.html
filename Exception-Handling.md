#### 23.3.2.2 Exception Handling

When executing the `python` command, Python exceptions uncaught within the Python code are translated to calls to [GDB] will terminate it and print an error message containing the Python exception name, the associated value, and the Python call stack backtrace at the point where the exception was raised. Example:

::: smallexample

```bash
(gdb) python print foo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
```

:::

[GDB] commands invoked by Python code are converted to Python exceptions. The type of the Python exception depends on the error.

`gdb.error`

:   This is the base class for most exceptions generated by [GDB].

```
If an error occurring in [GDB] does not fit into some more specific category, then the generated exception will have this type.
```

`gdb.MemoryError`

:   This is a subclass of `gdb.error` which is thrown when an operation tried to access invalid memory in the inferior.

`KeyboardInterrupt`

:   User interrupt (via [C-c] at a pagination prompt) is translated to a Python `KeyboardInterrupt` exception.

In all cases, your exception handler will see the [GDB] error occurred as the traceback.

When implementing [GDB] provides a special exception class that can be used for this purpose.

`gdb.GdbError`

:   When thrown from a command or function, this exception will cause the command or function to fail, but the Python stack will not be displayed. [GDB] does not throw this exception itself, but rather recognizes it when thrown from user Python code. Example:

```
::: smallexample
``` smallexample
(gdb) python
>class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
>  """Greet the whole world."""
>  def __init__ (self):
>    super (HelloWorld, self).__init__ ("hello-world", gdb.COMMAND_USER)
>  def invoke (self, args, from_tty):
>    argv = gdb.string_to_argv (args)
>    if len (argv) != 0:
>      raise gdb.GdbError ("hello-world takes no arguments")
>    print ("Hello, World!")
>HelloWorld ()
>end
(gdb) hello-world 42
hello-world takes no arguments
```
