#### 13.2.3 `save tracepoints filename`

This command saves all current tracepoint definitions together with their actions and passcounts, into a file `filename` suitable for use in a later debugging session. To read the saved tracepoint definitions, use the `source` command (see [Command Files](Command-Files.html#Command-Files)). The `save-tracepoints` command is a deprecated alias for `saveÂ tracepoints`
