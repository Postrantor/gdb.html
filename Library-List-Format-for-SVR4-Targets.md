### E.15 Library List Format for SVR4 Targets

On SVR4 platforms [GDB] remote protocol.

The '`qXfer:libraries-svr4:read`' packet returns an XML document which lists loaded libraries and their SVR4 linker parameters. For each library on SVR4 target, the following parameters are reported:

- \- `name`, the absolute file name from the `l_name` field of `struct link_map`.
- \- `lm` with address of `struct link_map` used for TLS (Thread Local Storage) access.
- \- `l_addr`, the displacement as read from the field `l_addr` of `struct link_map`. For prelinked libraries this is not an absolute memory address. It is a displacement of absolute memory address against address the file was prelinked to during the library load.
- \- `l_ld`, which is memory address of the `PT_DYNAMIC` segment
- \- `lmid`, which is an identifier for a linker namespace, such as the memory address of the `r_debug` object that contains this namespace's load map or the namespace identifier returned by `dlinfo (3)`.

Additionally the single `main-lm` attribute specifies address of `struct link_map` used for the main executable. This parameter is used for TLS access and its presence is optional.

[GDB] must be linked with the Expat library to support XML SVR4 library lists. See [Expat](Requirements.html#Expat).

A simple memory map, with two loaded libraries (which do not use prelink), looks like this:

::: smallexample

```bash
<library-list-svr4 version="1.0" main-lm="0xe4f8f8">
  <library name="/lib/ld-linux.so.2" lm="0xe4f51c" l_addr="0xe2d000"
           l_ld="0xe4eefc" lmid="0xfffe0"/>
  <library name="/lib/libc.so.6" lm="0xe4fbe8" l_addr="0x154000"
           l_ld="0x152350" lmid="0xfffe0"/>
</library-list-svr>
```

The format of an SVR4 library list is described by this DTD:

::: smallexample

```bash
<!-- library-list-svr4: Root element with versioning -->
<!ELEMENT library-list-svr4  (library)*>
<!ATTLIST library-list-svr4  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0">
<!ATTLIST library-list-svr4  main-lm CDATA   #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT library            EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST library            name    CDATA   #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST library            lm      CDATA   #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST library            l_addr  CDATA   #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST library            l_ld    CDATA   #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST library            lmid    CDATA   #IMPLIED>
```
