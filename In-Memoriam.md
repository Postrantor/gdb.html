## Appendix A In Memoriam

The [GDB] project mourns the loss of the following long-time contributors:

`Fred Fish`

:   Fred was a long-standing contributor to [GDB], he was known in the Amiga world for his series of Fish Disks, and the GeekGadget project.

`Michael Snyder`

:   Michael was one of the Global Maintainers of the [GDB].

Beyond their technical contributions to the project, they were also enjoyable members of the Free Software Community. We will miss them.
