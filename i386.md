#### 21.4.2 x86 Architecture-specific Issues

`set struct-convention mode`

:

```
Set the convention used by the inferior to return `struct`s and `union`s from functions to `mode` are `"pcc"`, `"reg"`, and `"default"` (the default). `"default"` or `"pcc"` means that `struct`s are returned on the stack, while `"reg"` means that a `struct` or a `union` whose size is 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes will be returned in a register.
```

`show struct-convention`

:

```
Show the current setting of the convention to return `struct`s from functions.
```

#### 21.4.2.1 Intel *Memory Protection Extensions* (MPX).


Memory Protection Extension (MPX) adds the bound registers '`BND0`'. Bound registers store a pair of 64-bit values which are the lower bound and upper bound. Bounds are effective addresses or memory locations. The upper bounds are architecturally represented in 1's complement form. A bound having lower bound = 0, and upper bound = 0 (1's complement of all bits set) will allow access to the entire address space.

> 内存保护扩展（MPX）添加了“BND0”绑定寄存器。绑定寄存器存储一对64位值，分别是下限和上限。边界是有效地址或内存位置。上限在体系结构上以1的补码形式表示。具有下限= 0，上限= 0（所有位设置的1的补码）的边界将允许访问整个地址空间。


'`BND0`' it will be `0xfff…`. In this sense it can also be noted that the upper bounds are inclusive.

> BND0对应的是 0xfff...。可以注意到，上限是包含在内的。


As an example, assume that the register BND0 holds bounds for a pointer having access allowed for the range between 0x32 and 0x71. The values present on bnd0raw and bnd registers are presented as follows:

> 例如，假设寄存器BND0保存了一个指针的边界，允许在0x32和0x71之间访问。bnd0raw和bnd寄存器上的值如下所示：

::: smallexample

```bash
  bnd0raw = 
    bnd0 =  : size 64
```

:::


This way the raw value can be accessed via bnd0raw...bnd3raw. Any change on bnd0...bnd3 or bnd0raw...bnd3raw is reflect on its counterpart. When the bnd0...bnd3 registers are displayed via Python, the display includes the memory size, in bits, accessible to the pointer.

> 这样，可以通过bnd0raw...bnd3raw访问原始值。对bnd0...bnd3或bnd0raw...bnd3raw的任何更改都会反映在其对应物上。当通过Python显示bnd0...bnd3寄存器时，显示中包括指针可访问的内存大小，以位为单位。


Bounds can also be stored in bounds tables, which are stored in application memory. These tables store bounds for pointers by specifying the bounds pointer's value along with its bounds. Evaluating and changing bounds located in bound tables is therefore interesting while investigating bugs on MPX context. [GDB] provides commands for this purpose:

> 边界也可以存储在边界表中，这些表存储在应用程序内存中。这些表通过指定边界指针的值及其边界来存储指针边界。因此，在调查MPX上下文的错误时，评估和更改边界表中的边界是有趣的。[GDB]提供了此目的的命令：

`show mpx bound pointer`

:

```
Display bounds of the given `pointer`.
```

`set mpx bound pointer, lbound, ubound`

:

```
Set the bounds of a pointer in the bound table. This command takes three parameters: `pointer` are new values for lower and upper bounds respectively.
```


When you call an inferior function on an Intel MPX enabled program, GDB sets the inferior's bound registers to the init (disabled) state before calling the function. As a consequence, bounds checks for the pointer arguments passed to the function will always pass.

> 当您在Intel MPX启用的程序上调用较低级别的函数时，GDB会在调用函数之前将下级注册表设置为init（禁用）状态。因此，传递给函数的指针参数的边界检查将始终通过。


This is necessary because when you call an inferior function, the program is usually in the middle of the execution of other function. Since at that point bound registers are in an arbitrary state, not clearing them would lead to random bound violations in the called function.

> 这是必要的，因为当你调用一个次级函数时，程序通常处于执行其他函数的中间。由于在那个时候绑定的寄存器处于任意状态，如果不清除它们会导致被调用函数中随机的绑定违规。


You can still examine the influence of the bound registers on the execution of the called function by stopping the execution of the called function at its prologue, setting bound registers, and continuing the execution. For example:

> 你可以通过在调用函数的序言处停止执行，设置边界寄存器，然后继续执行，来研究边界寄存器对调用函数执行的影响。例如：

::: smallexample

```bash
  $ break *upper
    Breakpoint 2 at 0x4009de: file i386-mpx-call.c, line 47.
    $ print upper (a, b, c, d, 1)
    Breakpoint 2, upper (a=0x0, b=0x6e0000005b, c=0x0, d=0x0, len=48)....
    $ print $bnd0
     : size -1
```

:::


At this last step the value of bnd0 can be changed for investigation of bound violations caused along the execution of the call. In order to know how to set the bound registers or bound table for the call consult the ABI.

> 在最后一步，可以更改bnd0的值，以调查在调用执行过程中导致的界限违规。要了解如何设置调用的界限寄存器或界限表，请参阅ABI。
