#### 15.4.1 C and C++

Since C and C++ are so closely related, many features of [GDB] apply to both languages. Whenever this is the case, we discuss those languages together.

The C++ debugging facilities are jointly implemented by the C++ compiler and [GDB] `g++`, or the HP ANSI C++ compiler (`aCC`).
