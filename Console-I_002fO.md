#### E.13.6 Console I/O

By default and if not explicitly closed by the target system, the file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are connected to the [GDB] so that after the target read request from file descriptor 0 all following typing is buffered until either one of the following conditions is met:

- The user types [Ctrl-c]. The behaviour is as explained above, and the `read` system call is treated as finished.
- The user presses RET. This is treated as end of input with a trailing newline.
- The user types [Ctrl-d]') is appended to the input.

If the user has typed more characters than fit in the buffer given to the `read` call, the trailing characters are buffered in [GDB] until either another `read(0, â€¦)` is requested by the target, or debugging is stopped at the user's request.
